Hello! I am **Fahim Shahriar Khan**, a third-semester **Ph.D. student in Computer Science** at the **University of Texas at Arlington**. I have over **2 years of industry experience** working as an **ML/AI Engineer**, where I specialized in developing and deploying scalable AI solutions tailored to client needs. Currently, my research lies in the field of **Big Data management and mining**, where I explore scalable techniques for managing, processing, and extracting insights from large-scale datasets.

Outside of research, I enjoy sharing knowledge and discussing emerging topics in Data Driven Systems. Also, I am a huge football fan and Chelsea is my club. KEEP THE BLUE FLAG FLYING HIGH!
